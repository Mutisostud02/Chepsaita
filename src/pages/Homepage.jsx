        <h3>About Us</h3>
        <p>
          We are a sports development initiative committed to empowering young
          athletes across Kenya through professional training, talent
          development, and equipment support. Our programs span football,
          athletics, swimming, cycling, and volleyball, led by experienced
          coaches dedicated to nurturing potential.
        </p>
        <p>
          We also run an equipment donation program, ensuring that no athlete is
          held back by financial limitations. Through community outreach and
          organized events, we actively identify and support promising talent in
          both urban and rural areas.
